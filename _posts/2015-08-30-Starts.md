#### This is a new blog.

I have a permanent home for my posts now. I've always enjoyed sharing/communicating my ideas and observations to the world, and having a blog enables me to do just that.

I've always attempted to dedicate myself into writing regularly but never quite followed through. I'm not going to attempt to get started on my list of plausible excuses, so let's just say those were all false starts - life is full of them anyway.

I'm starting work at [buUuk](http://buuuk.com/) again tomorrow, so perhaps that'll breathe enough "interesting" into my life to convince me to write more often.

Perhaps this time I will start this right?
