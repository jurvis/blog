As mentioned in my [previous post](http://blog.jurvis.co/2015/10/10/disrupting-routines/) I did go mountain biking today. In essence, I got pretty messed up but I enjoyed every moment of being a beginner at something new.

I kind of went into it without cycling for close to a year and a half, so having to be thrown into the deep end of the pool with a tough trail like Bukit Timah hill was really challenging. I felt really stupid, cowardly, and slow for the most part because I really struggled to get down and up the terrains when Paul was just zipping by them like it's nothing. It's okay though, I guess it's just part of the process with everything.

I ran into trees a total of three times and probably stalled on climbs more times than I can count. On one descent, while going through a bunch of rocks, my front tyre's side skidded against the rocks and I eventually lost control and fell. The damage was pretty bad on my left elbow because I decided to not wear guards and I guess I just ran my elbow through a rock while doing a barrel roll. (lol)

Thankfully, a couple of guys we were pacing with during the trail had a first aid kit with them, so we managed to wash the open wound with some alcohol and dressed it up a bit. One guy then exclaimed "lick it and move on!" I think that comment really stood out for me because I guess mountain biking, like skiing or any mountain sport, requires a certain level of faith in order to do well in it. Sometimes you just have to muster your courage lean in on hills/slopes in order to not get yourself in worse accidents.

So here's what I learned about myself thus far going into this new sport:

1. I like feeling stupid
2. I always need to be on my feet to learn something new that's outside of my comfort zone to grow as a person
3. Challenging myself especially with something _physically and mentally_ is pretty damn refreshing
4. Being a beginner at something new is awesome.

I'm really excited to get better at it, and cannot wait till the next time we go mountain biking again.

1. Thanks
 Paul for sticking around to help me!
2. This is my first time writing anything remotely like a narrative, so I do apologize for the poor writing. I'm not very good with using adjectives.
