I really don't have much to say about it, except leaving now really feels like leaving the first house you grew up in.

My learning and growth as a young adult has accelerated so much at buUuk the experience is quite surreal. Albeit short stints, those will be the things I still remember for many years to come.

It's unlikely for me to be back because it's probably for the best I head out there and seek fresh opportunities and experience new work environments. I can't wait for what's next.

From here, there's only one way forward; onwards and upwards.
